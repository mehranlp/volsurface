# ðŸ“ˆ Interactive Implied Volatility Surface Dashboard

This project is a fully interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes the **implied volatility surface** of call options for any U.S. stock ticker. The dashboard is built using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**, and computes implied volatilities using a custom **Black-Scholes + JAX-based Newton-Raphson solver** â€” not market-provided IVs.

## Implied Volatility Calculation

Implied volatility is computed using a **custom Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm** applied to the Black-Scholes pricing formula:

```python
sigma = sigma - f(sigma) / f'(sigma)
